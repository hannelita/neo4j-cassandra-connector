Welcome to [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/) [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) Connector. The main goal of this project is to import a specific Tracks dataset that is in a Cassandra to a graph structure in Neo4j. 

Please be aware that this project is still under development and at this first stage it will work mainly for this restricted data collection.
